# ML-Web-App

This repository contains the `ML Web App`, a web application built using Streamlit that showcases handwritten digit recognition using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features

- **Handwritten Digit Recognition**: Train and save a model to recognize handwritten digits.
- **Predict Digits**: Load the trained model and make predictions on new data.

## How to Use

1. **Train and Save Model**: Click the "Train and Save Model" button to train the model and save it.
2. **Predict Digits**: Click the "Predict Digits" button to load the trained model and make predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Installation
